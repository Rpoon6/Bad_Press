As a user, I want to be able to:
- search by state so that I can learn who are the senate candidates
- search by senate candidate so I can find out more information about them
- find topics I care about on the candidate’s page
- have coherent text summaries of articles about each candidate
- see trends about each candidate’s activity and voting patterns
